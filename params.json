  "body": "**bit7z** is a C++ static library which allows to compress and extract many file archive formats,  all through a clean, simple and entirely object-oriented interface with the dynamic libraries from the 7-zip SDK. It supports compression and extraction to and from the filesystem or the memory.\r\n\r\n[![](http://img.shields.io/badge/stable-v1.0.0-blue.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/rikyoz/bit7z/releases/latest)\r\n[![](http://img.shields.io/badge/latest-v2.0.0--beta-yellow.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/rikyoz/bit7z/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta)\r\n![](http://img.shields.io/badge/compiler-MSVC-red.svg?style=flat)\r\n![](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-GNU%20GPL%20v2-lightgrey.svg?style=flat)\r\n\r\n## Features\r\nbit7z supports the following features:\r\n\r\n+ **Compression of files and directories** with the following archive formats: 7z, XZ, BZIP2, GZIP, TAR, ZIP and WIM.\r\n+ **Extraction** of the following archive formats: 7z, ARJ, BZIP2, CAB, CHM, CPIO, CramFS, DEB, DMG, FAT, GZIP, HFS, ISO, LZH, LZMA, MBR, MSI, NSIS, NTFS, RAR, RPM, SquashFS, TAR, UDF, VHD, WIM, XAR, XZ, Z and ZIP.\r\n+ Support to **compression and extraction to and from memory** (compression to memory is supported only for BZIP2, GZIP, XZ and TAR formats).\r\n+ Creation of **encrypted archives** (only for 7z and ZIP formats).\r\n+ **Archive header encryption** (only for 7z format).\r\n+ Choice of the **compression level** (from none to ultra, depending on the output archive format).\r\n+ **Solid archives** (only for 7z).\r\n\r\nPlease note that the presence or not of some of these features depends on the particular .dll used along with bit7z. For example, the 7z.dll should support all these features, while 7za.dll should support only the 7z file format and the 7zxa.dll can only extract 7z files. For more information about the 7z SDK DLLs, please see this [wiki page](https://github.com/rikyoz/bit7z/wiki/7z-DLLs).\r\n\r\n## Getting Started (Library Usage)\r\n\r\nBelow are a few examples that show how to use some of the main features of bit7z:\r\n\r\n### Extracting files from an archive\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}\r\nBit7zLibrary lib(L\"7za.dll\");\r\nBitExtractor extractor(lib, BitFormat::SevenZip);\r\n\t\r\n//extracts a simple archive\r\nextractor.extract(L\"path/to/archive.7z\", L\"output/dir/\");\r\n\r\n//extracts the first file of an archive to a buffer\r\nvector<byte_t> buffer;\r\nextractor.extract(L\"path/to/archive.7z\", buffer);\r\n\r\n//extracts an encrypted archive\r\nextractor.setPassword(L\"password\");\r\nextractor.extract(L\"path/to/another/archive.7z\", L\"output/dir/\");\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n### Compressing files into an archive\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}\r\nBit7zLibrary lib(L\"7z.dll\");\r\nBitCompressor compressor(lib, BitFormat::Zip);\r\n\r\nstd::vector<std::wstring> files = {L\"path/to/file1.jpg\", L\"path/to/file2.pdf\"};\r\n//creates a simple zip archive of two files\r\ncompressor.compressFiles(files, L\"output_archive.zip\");\r\n\r\n//creates an encrypted zip archive of two files\r\ncompressor.setPassword(L\"password\");\r\ncompressor.compressFiles(files, L\"protected_archive.zip\");\r\n\r\n//compresses a directory\r\ncompressor.compressDirectory(L\"dir/path/\", L\"dir_archive.zip\");\r\n\r\n//compresses a single file into a buffer\r\nvector<byte_t> buffer;\r\nBitCompressor compressor2(lib, BitFormat::BZip2);\r\ncompressor2.compressFile(files[0], buffer);\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nA complete ***[API reference](https://github.com/rikyoz/bit7z/wiki/API-Reference)*** and a ***[Getting Started](https://github.com/rikyoz/bit7z/wiki/Getting-Started)*** guide are available in the [wiki](https://github.com/rikyoz/bit7z/wiki/) section.\r\n\r\n## Downloads\r\n\r\n[Latest stable release](https://github.com/rikyoz/bit7z/releases/latest)\r\n\r\n[Latest release](https://github.com/rikyoz/bit7z/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta)\r\n\r\nThe release packages contain a precompiled version of the library and they are available for both x86 and x64 architectures.\r\n\r\nObviously, you can also clone/download repository this repository and build the library by yourself (please, see the [wiki](https://github.com/rikyoz/bit7z/wiki/Building-bit7z)).\r\n\r\n## Usage Requirements\r\n+ **Target OS:** Windows (both x86 and x64)\r\n+ **Compiler:** MSVC (tested with version 2013)\r\n+ **DLLs:** 7-zip DLLs (v9.20, newer versions were not tested with bit7z)\r\n\r\nThe 7zip dlls are not shipped with bit7z but they are available at [7-zip.org](http://www.7-zip.org/)\r\n\r\n**Note**: in order to use this library you should link your program with both **bit7z** and *oleaut32* (e.g. `-lbit7z -loleaut32`)\r\n\r\n## Building bit7z\r\n\r\nA complete guide on how to build this library is available [here](https://github.com/rikyoz/bit7z/wiki/Building-bit7z).\r\n\r\n## License (GPL v2)\r\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
